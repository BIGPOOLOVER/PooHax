PooHax is actually a joke this isn't really meant to be a good script-hub, im just using it while im learning lua.

I'm dumb and currently learning lua, most of these scripts are tests and probably wont work well.
anyways heres the little wannabe script hub
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIGPOOLOVER/PooHax/main/loader.lua",true))()
```
