# A LARGE PORTION OF THE POOHAX CODE IS CONTAINED IN https://github.com/BIGPOOLOVER/Actually-PooHax
PooHax is actually a joke this isn't really meant to be a good script-hub, im just using it while im learning lua.

I'm dumb and currently learning lua, most of these scripts are tests and probably wont work well.
anyways heres the little wannabe script hub
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BIGPOOLOVER/PooHax/main/loader.lua",true))()
```
# Changelog 7/23/24
- Removed teleporting back to spawn button in the Glass Bridge Game, was only used to get back to spawn after going to VIP area
- Added removing VIP doors button in the Glass Bridge Game, no longer needed teleporting back to spawn
- Most likely changing the UI Lib to Bracket v3.3 in a little (in 2 centuries)
# More Soon!
